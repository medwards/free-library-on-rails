Here are some basic installation instructions:
prelude: we assume you are using an apache+mysql setup /w mod_passenger
1) gem install hpricot(ruby1.8-dev)
2) rake db:create (alternatively create the database and add the user)
   - sudo gem install -v=2.3.2 rails 
   - sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16-dev
   - sudo gem install mysql
   - edit config/databasa.yml
     database name, username and password 
3) rake db:migrate
   - sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
4) rake secret -> copy this and place it as your session key secret in config/environment.rb
5) ensure mod_rewrite is enabled (under debian-based simply run a2enmod rewrite with admin privileges)

Things like isbnDB and GoogleBooks API tokens are set in config/application.yml
You can get an isbnDB api token from this page https://isbndb.com/account/create.html
You can get a Google Maps api token from this page http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
There is no guarantee that the API tokens stored in config/application.yml will work for you.

There are other things you can change in config/application.yml (like a tags blacklist if you have problems with swearing or pro-capitalists)
