Here are some basic installation instructions:
prelude: we assume you are using an apache+mysql setup /w mod_passenger
1) gem install hpricot
2) rake db:create (alternatively create the database and add the user)
3) rake db:migrate
4) rake secret -> copy this and place it as your session key secret in config/environment.rb
5) ensure mod_rewrite is enabled (under debian-based simply run a2enmod rewrite with admin privileges)

Things like isbnDB and GoogleBooks API tokens are set in config/application.yml
You can get an isbnDB api token from this page https://isbndb.com/account/create.html
You can get a Google Maps api token from this page http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
There is no guarantee that the API tokens stored in config/application.yml will work for you.

There are other things you can change in config/application.yml (like a tags blacklist if you have problems with swearing or pro-capitalists)
